Building container images is not too hard once you understand the basics. Understanding best practices for executing images in a secure way, as well as constructing the image itself to reduce the potential for security issues is much harder.

This workshop would usually be done in conjunction with another workshop on those basics. If you have already used containers and know how to build container images, that's okay and you can start here. If not, you may want to find and do the workshop on container basics first.

Having understood the basics, this workshop we will cover topics related to building containers with security in mind, as well as some tips on how best to run them.
